# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Kast

I'm a retired U.S. Navy leader and current facilities team manager at Navy Federal Credit Union. I'm also a student of data science and machine learning, focused on building reproducible workflows, interpretable models, and stakeholder-ready insights.

## 🧠 What I'm Working On

- Benchmarking tabular models like TabTransformer, MLP, and Logistic Regression
- Visualizing model performance with ROC, precision-recall, and confusion matrices
- Building modular pipelines for reproducible research and educational communication

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, SAS, R
- Model evaluation, interpretability, and workflow documentation
- Strategic troubleshooting and peer mentoring

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Improve recall and precision tradeoffs in imbalanced classification
- Explore ensemble methods and threshold tuning
- Share insights through clean, copy-friendly notebooks and dashboards

## 📦 Featured Project

- [ANA 500 BRFSS Diabetes Prediction Project](https://github.com/Daniel-Kast/Daniel-Kast-ANA-500-BRFSS-Project)
